**Gaming Tournament DApp - Decentralized Tournament Brackets with Prize Pools**

## 2. Project Vision
To revolutionize competitive gaming by creating a transparent, decentralized platform where gamers can participate in tournaments with guaranteed prize distribution, eliminating the need for centralized authorities and ensuring fair play through blockchain technology.

## 3. Project Description
The Gaming Tournament DApp is a blockchain-based solution that enables the creation and management of gaming tournaments with automated prize pool distribution.
